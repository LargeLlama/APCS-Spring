Knight's Tour algorithm

recursive solution (similar to queen problem)

if all squares visited
	return true
else
	Try one of the next moves, keeping in mind you can't visit a square already visited
	if this move doesnt lead to solution
		backtrack and try another one
		(knight can have, at most, 8 moves in the center of the board)
	if no alternatives work (no more possible moves)
		return false and you done son (no possible solution)


this is recursive because we would make a call to the method again, with the state space being changed after each call

this is harder to do by hand, as there are so many possible moves that one can do but a computer can calculate these faster than a person
I doubt this is the fastest method, as we do not "chop off" moves we know will not work, as mentioned in class, but this is what I came up with
